# Assisted learning for land use classification: The important role of semantic correlation between heterogeneous images

This work is still under review.

This work propose an innovative assisted learning framework that employs a "teacher-student" architecture equipped with local and global distillation schemes. 

It has several advantages as outlined below:

- **Ability to maintain performance during testing with missing modalities**
  
- **High interpretability demonstrating knowledge transferability between different modalities**
  
- **Simplicity and flexibility**

Below is the process of the proposed framework:

Step 1: Training teacher models using cross-entropy and dice loss.

Step 2: Training student models using our framework.

Step 3: Testing under missing modal conditions and maintain performance.
